# NameSys: Off-chain ENS Records Manager

### Universal Resolver with Gasless ENS Records Management using IPNS and CCIP-Read

##### author(s) : [`freetib.eth`](@0xc0de4c0ffee), [`sshmatrix.eth`](@sshmatrix)

## Abstract

This document introduces an optional specification for Resolvers to fetch and render ENS records with `CCIP-Read` (ENSIP-10) using IPNS and RFC-8615 `.well-known` standard. The outlined implementation doesn't need web2 gateways to relay off-chain records and instead relies on hosting of records on IPNS. Users can host these records themselves on IPNS using the proper format or alternatively use the dedicated NameSys client, both of which result in a gasless, upgradeable and autonomous implementation. This specification is fully optional and ENS users must manually switch their Resolver address to enable the features included therein.

## Motivation

ENS has the potential to revolutionise decentralised access to the web with an attached identity system through linked records, but the usage of ENS records seems to have pleatued. This is a consequence of intrinsically high gas costs associated with adding and updating the records since there are no additional fees to set records. While IPNS has reduced the gas costs associated with updating `contenthash`, other records appear to either be unset or rarely updated once set.

This specification solves the aforementioned problem of high gas costs by storing the ENS records off-chain inside `.well-known` (RFC8615) directory of the users' IPNS contenthash. Records stored under `.well-known` standard can then be queried through [ENSIP-10](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-10-wildcard-resolution) (`CCIP-Read`) implemented in this specification. The implementation outlined here doesn't require any additional gateways to fetch and render the ENS records, and the user is fully in control of their records, e.g. hosting the records on IPFS and linking the IPFS hash to their IPNS key. With this method, users are able to update their records as often as possible at no cost whatsoever without ever losing custody of their data (see figure below). We believe that this specification will enable frequent updates of records other than the `contenthash` and propel ENS adoption as an identity layer.

## Specification

The proposed Resolver and ENS records storage outlined in this document expects the following implementation:

### a) CCIP-Read Resolver (ENSIP-10)

This specification is an extension of ENSIP-10 `CCIP-Read`



### b) Off-Chain Records Storage

For this specification to make pratical sense, we expect the `contenhash` to be of IPNS type. IPNS hashes are key-based decentralised storage pointers that only need to be added once to on-chain storage by the user. IPNS hashes can in turn serve as proxy and point to upgradeable IPFS or IPLD content. In the parent IPNS directory, the records must be stored in the [RFC-8615](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8615) compliant `.well-known` directory format. ENS records for any name `sub.domain.eth` must then be stored in JSON format under a [reverse-DNS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_domain_name_notation) type directory path using `/` instead of `.` as separator, i.e. in format `.well-known/eth/domain/sub/<record>.json`.

**1. Some Examples:**

- ENS text record for `vitalik.eth`'s avatar is stored at `https://vitalik.eth.limo/.well-known/eth/vitalik/avatar.json` formatted as

```solidity
{ data: abi.encode(string("eip155:1/erc1155:0xb32979486938aa9694bfc898f35dbed459f44424/10063")) }
```

- ETH address record for `sub.domain.eth` is stored at `https://sub.domain.eth/.well-known/eth/domain/sub/addr-60.json` formatted as

```solidity
{ data: abi.encode(<addr-60>) }
```

Note: If the JSON data is signed by the Registrant of `domain.eth`, it must be prefixed with `bytes4` of `callback` function selector as,

```solidity
{ data: bytes.concat(Resolver.___callback.selector, <signed_data>}
```

**2. Resolver function â†’ JSON file names:**

| Type | Function | JSON file |
| -- | -- | --- |
| Text Records ([ENSIP-05](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-5-text-records)) | `text(bytes32 node, string memory key)` | `<key>.json` |
| Ethereum Address | `addr(bytes32 node)` | `addr-60.json` |
| Multichain Address ([ENSIP-09](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-9-multichain-address-resolution)) | `addr(bytes32 node, uint coinType)`| `addr-<coinType>.json` |
| Public Key | `pubkey(bytes32 node)`| `pubkey.json` |
| Contenthash ([ENSIP-07](https://docs.ens.domains/ens-improvement-proposals/ensip-7-contenthash-field)) | `contenthash(bytes32 node)` | `contenthash.json` |


### CCIP Gateways

| Type | Identifier | Gateway URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ipns://<contenthash>` | `0xe5` | `https://<base36-CID-v1>.ipns.dweb.link/.well-known/..` |
| `ipfs://<contenthash>` | `0xe3` | `https://<base32-CID-v1>.ipfs.dweb.link/.well-known/..` |
| ENS + IPNS Node| &nbsp; | `https://domain-eth.ipns.dweb.link/.well-known/..` |
| ENS | &nbsp; | `https://domain.eth.limo/.well-known/..` |
| ENS + IPFS2 resolver| `0xe3`, `0xe5` | `https://<CID-v1>.ipfs2.eth.limo/.well-known/..` |
