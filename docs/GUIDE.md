# How to NameSys

### Guide to setting Off-chain ENS Records on IPFS Network with NameSys

##### author(s) : [`sshmatrix.eth`](@sshmatrix), [`freetib.eth`](@0xc0de4c0ffee)

## Prerequisites

- **OWN** an ENS (sub)domain, whether Legacy or Wrapped

## NameSys Client

NameSys client lets you set off-chain recordsr for your ENS name and it is available on [NameSys.xyz]((https://namesys.xyz)) and [NameSys.eth]((https://namesys.eth.limo)).

### Step 1

Connect your wallet to the client

### Step 2

`Search` for a name, or go to `MY NAMES` to see all ENS names in your wallet.

> `MY NAMES` DOES NOT show wrapped domains or subdomains due to our indexing limitations. Please use the search function to query those names

#### `Search` Example

#### `MY NAMES` Example

### Step 3

Choose a name that you want to set records for by clicking on `EDIT`. You can only set records for names that you **OWN**. You will see the details of the name you chose after clicking on `EDIT`.

### Step 3

To start using NameSys, you must migrate the resolver to NameSys resolver (officially called `CCIP2.eth: 0x839B3B540A9572448FD1B2335e0EB09Ac1A02885`). To do so, simply click on `MIGRATE`.

&nbsp;

#### Step 3a

You will reach a panel with three choices. These choice represent the kind of storage that your records will use, and this choice will be set on-chain with a transaction in the next step.

- `RECORDHASH` option is the IPNS storage which contains the records for the name that you have selected. One `RECORDHASH` corresponds to **only one** ENS name. This is the most secure and arguably the fastest option in terms of record resolution. However, it also means that each IPNS Recordhash must be set on-chain (once per name). This is not the cheapest solution (even though it is significantly cheaper than on-chain records) since Recordhash must be set **at least once per name**.

- `OWNERHASH` option is the IPNS storage which can contain records for multiple (or all) names in your wallet. This is very cheap since Ownerhash must be set **only once per wallet**. However, Ownerhash option is somewhat less secure since it is equivalent to putting all your eggs in one basket; Recordhash option in comparison is one egg per basket scenario instead. It is up to the users to choose whether they prefer security over gas costs or otherwise.

**NOTE:** Ownerhash option will be disabled at the beginning for all users since no such Ownerhash will be set at the start. It can be set for your wallet in `UTILS` tab and the steps for it are explained at the end of this document. Let's pretend for now that the user chooses the only available option of `RECORDHASH`.

#### Step 3b

Upon clicking `RECORDHASH`:

- Transaction `TXN 1` will be triggered and confirming this migrate the resolver to `CCIP2.eth: 0x839B3B540A9572448FD1B2335e0EB09Ac1A02885`.

&nbsp;

- Once `TXN 1` is confirmed successfully, user will be prompted to choose their **secret** PNS Key Identifier. This identifier is equivalent to a secret password for your IPNS Recordhash and you can replace your Recordhash in the future if necessary by choosing a different password. **This password must be kept secret!** You will also be required to enter this password when updating your off-chain records.

&nbsp;
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namesys-eth/ccip2-eth-resources/main/graphics/png/guide/Password.png)

- Upon entering the identifier, signature `SIGN 1` will be triggered. This signature is required to generate your IPNS Recordhash which will store your off-chain records on IPFS network.

&nbsp;
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namesys-eth/ccip2-eth-resources/main/graphics/png/guide/SIGN1.png)

- Confirming `SIGN 1` this will trigger signature `SIGN 2`; this is required to generate the records Signer which will sign your records for verification. This steps ensures the safety and sanctity of your records.

&nbsp;
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namesys-eth/ccip2-eth-resources/main/graphics/png/guide/SIGN2.png)

- Confirming `SIGN 2` will trigger transaction `TXN 2` which will set the on-chain IPNS Recordhash that you generated with `SIGN 1`

&nbsp;

Confirmtion of `TXN 2` completes the setup process and you are now ready to use off-chain records for your ENS name! ðŸ¥³

### Step 3c

We had assumed earlier that user wanted to use the `RECORDHASH` option in **Step 3a**. If a user (degen) has many names in their wallet, they may prefer the cheaper `OWNERHASH` option for some or all of their names. Let's set the `OWNERHASH` option now. To do this, head over to the `UTILS` tab under `MY NAMES`.

&nbsp;
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namesys-eth/ccip2-eth-resources/main/graphics/png/guide/Ownerhash.png)

Here you can set the `OWNERHASH` option by clicking on `SET`. The procedure for this is the same for Recordhash option and you will go through `SIGN 1`, `SIGN 2` and `TXN 2` steps similar to when we had set the Rcordhash. Upon confirmtion, the `OWNERHASH` option will become active **Step 3a**! Now you may set records for all your remaining names in Ownerhash and `TXN 2` won't need to repeated again (unless the user chooses to explicitly).

### Step 4

Let's now finally set those damn records! Open the preview panel again for a name that is already set up. Irrespective of whether that name has either the Recordhash or the Ownerhash set, you will find the record fields activated.

> Currently, NameSys supports setting `AVATAR`, `ADDRESS`, `CONTENTHASH` only but this list can be extended at zero cost and we intend to add more records to it soon!

&nbsp;
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namesys-eth/ccip2-eth-resources/main/graphics/png/guide/enterValues.png)

- Simply, enter the valid values for the records and click on `EDIT`, or `EDIT ALL` to set multiple records simultaneously. Upon clicking, you will be requested for the IPNS Key Identifier, `SIGN 1`, `SIGN 2` and additionally `SIGN 3` for approving the Signer. This approval is required by `CCIP2.eth` Resolver to validate the Signer.

&nbsp;
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namesys-eth/ccip2-eth-resources/main/graphics/png/guide/approveSigner.png)

Upon approving this signature, your records will be set and you will see your gas savings on the screen!

Congratulations of setting off-chain and secure records on IPFS for your ENS name! ðŸ¥³
