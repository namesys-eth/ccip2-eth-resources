# How to NameSys

### Guide to setting Off-chain ENS Records on IPFS Network with NameSys

##### author(s) : [`sshmatrix.eth`](@sshmatrix), [`freetib.eth`](@0xc0de4c0ffee)

## Prerequisites

- **OWN** an ENS (sub)domain, whether Legacy or Wrapped

## NameSys Client

NameSys Client lets you set Off-chain Records for your ENS name and it is available on:

- [`NameSys.xyz`](https://namesys.xyz)
- [`NameSys.eth`](https://namesys.eth.limo)
- [`CCIP2.eth`](https://ccip2.eth.limo)

## Step 1

Connect your Wallet to the Client

## Step 2

`Search` for a name, or go to `MY NAMES` to see all ENS names in your wallet.

> `MY NAMES` DOES NOT show wrapped domains or subdomains due to our indexing limitations. Please use the search function to query those names

### 2a: `Search`

### 2b: `MY NAMES`

## Step 3

Choose a name that you want to set records for by clicking on `EDIT`. You can only set records for names that you **OWN**. You will see the details of the name you chose after clicking on `EDIT`.

## Step 4

To start using NameSys, you must migrate from your current Resolver to the NameSys Resolver (officially called `CCIP2.eth:` `0x839B3B540A9572448FD1B2335e0EB09Ac1A02885`). To do so, simply click on `MIGRATE`.

&nbsp;
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namesys-eth/ccip2-eth-resources/main/graphics/guide/Migrate.png" width="500">

### Step 4a

You will reach a panel with three choices. These choices represent the kind of storage that your records will use, and this choice will be set on-chain with a transaction in the next step.

> Third option of an `HTTP Gateway` is not yet available but it will be available in v2

&nbsp;

- `RECORDHASH` option is the IPNS storage which contains the records for the name that you have selected. One `RECORDHASH` corresponds to **only one** ENS name. This is the most secure and arguably the fastest option in terms of record resolution. However, it also means that IPNS Recordhash for each name must be set on-chain. This is not the cheapest solution (even though it is significantly cheaper than on-chain records) since Recordhash must be set **at least once per name**.

- `OWNERHASH` option is the IPNS storage which can contain records for multiple (or all) names in your wallet. This is very cheap since Ownerhash must be set **only once per wallet**. However, Ownerhash option is somewhat less secure since it is equivalent to putting all your eggs in one basket; Recordhash option in comparison is one egg per basket scenario instead. It is up to the users to choose whether they prefer security over gas costs or otherwise.

**NOTE:** Ownerhash option will be disabled at the beginning for all users since no such Ownerhash will be set at the start. It can be set for your wallet in `UTILS` tab and the steps for it are explained at the end of this document. Let's pretend for now that the user chooses the only available option of `RECORDHASH`.

### Step 4b

Upon clicking `RECORDHASH`:

- Transaction `TXN 1` will be triggered and confirming this will migrate the Resolver to `CCIP2.eth: 0x839B3B540A9572448FD1B2335e0EB09Ac1A02885`.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- Once `TXN 1` is confirmed successfully, user will be prompted to choose their **secret** IPNS Key Identifier/Password. This identifier is equivalent to a secret password for your IPNS Recordhash, and you can replace your Recordhash in the future whenever required by choosing a different password. **This password must be kept secret!** You will also be required to enter this password when updating your off-chain records.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

- Upon entering the identifier, signature `SIGN 1` will be triggered. This signature is required to generate your IPNS Recordhash which will store your off-chain records on IPFS network.

&nbsp;
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namesys-eth/ccip2-eth-resources/main/graphics/guide/SIGN1.png" width="700">
&nbsp;

- Confirming `SIGN 1` will trigger signature `SIGN 2`; this is required to generate the records Signer key which will sign your records for verification. This steps ensures the safety and sanctity of your records.

&nbsp;
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namesys-eth/ccip2-eth-resources/main/graphics/guide/SIGN2.png" width="700">
&nbsp;

- Confirming `SIGN 2` will trigger transaction `TXN 2` which will set the on-chain IPNS Recordhash that you generated with `SIGN 1`

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Confirmtion of `TXN 2` completes the setup process and you are now ready to use off-chain records for your ENS name! ðŸ¥³

## Step 5

We had assumed earlier that the user wanted to use the `RECORDHASH` option in **Step 3a**. If a user (degen) has many names in their wallet, they may prefer the cheaper `OWNERHASH` option for some or all of their names. Let's set the `OWNERHASH` option now. To do this, head over to the `UTILS` tab under `MY NAMES`.

&nbsp;
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namesys-eth/ccip2-eth-resources/main/graphics/guide/Ownerhash.png" width="400">
&nbsp;

Here you can set the `OWNERHASH` option by clicking on `SET`. The procedure for this is the same for Recordhash option and you will go through `SIGN 1`, `SIGN 2` and `TXN 2` steps similar to when we had set the Rcordhash. Upon confirmtion, the `OWNERHASH` option will become active in the preview panel! Now you may set records for all your remaining names in Ownerhash and `TXN 2` won't need to be repeated again (unless the user chooses to explicitly).

&nbsp;
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namesys-eth/ccip2-eth-resources/main/graphics/guide/ownerhashDialog.png" width="400">
&nbsp;

> Note 1: When both Ownerhash and Recordhash are set, then Recordhash has the higher preference

> Note 2: It advised to update records on IPNS no more than once per hour. Client enforces this limit.

## Step 6

Let's now finally set those damn records! Open the preview panel again for a name that is already set up. Irrespective of whether that name has either the Recordhash or the Ownerhash set, you will find the record fields activated. Simply, enter the valid values for the records and click on `EDIT`, or `EDIT ALL` to set multiple records simultaneously.

> Currently, NameSys supports setting `AVATAR`, `ADDRESS`, `CONTENTHASH` only but this list can be extended at zero cost and we intend to add more records to it soon!

&nbsp;
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namesys-eth/ccip2-eth-resources/main/graphics/guide/enterValues.png" width="500">
&nbsp;

- Upon clicking, you will be requested for the IPNS Key Identifier, `SIGN 1`, `SIGN 2` and additionally `SIGN 3` for approving the Signer. `SIGN 3` approval is required by `CCIP2.eth` Resolver to validate the Signer.

&nbsp;
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/namesys-eth/ccip2-eth-resources/main/graphics/guide/SIGN3.png" width="700">
&nbsp;

> NameSys also offers the option to set an on-chain Signer for better security and using this option will remove the need for `SIGN3`; this however adds more gas costs due to setting the Signer on-chain

Upon approving this signature, your records will be set and you will see your gas savings on the screen!

Congratulations of setting off-chain and secure records on IPFS for your ENS name! ðŸ¥³
