NameSys.eth is introducing an innovative solution for Ethereum Name Service (ENS) users to store their ENS records off-chain in a gasless and autonomous manner. By combining IPNS and CCIP-Read, NameSys allows users to enjoy free ENS record updates and dynamic avatars. This unique approach addresses the long-standing issue of high gas costs associated with on-chain updates, making it accessible to ENS enthusiasts of all levels.

The NameSys infrastructure uses a custom resolver called CCIP2, which reads off-chain records from IPNS. Since hosting sensitive records on centralized servers poses significant trust concerns, NameSys designed a non-custodial and secure solution for IPNS record storage. Users can securely generate IPNS keypairs using wallet signatures and a provided password. The IPNS private key is used to host off-chain records without sharing it with any third-party service, ensuring data integrity.

The NameSys process involves a one-time initial setup, where users set their resolver to CCIP2 and establish their parent IPNS contenthash on-chain. This contenthash serves as a container for the typical ENS records. With each record update, users sign the data with their unique signature in Metamask and enter the password for deterministic IPNS key generation. The records are then pinned to the IPNS public key using the w3name API. Subsequent IPNS key regeneration requires the user's signature and secret password, offering a robust and secure mechanism.

While NameSys ensures a similar level of security to on-chain records, it does come with a trade-off. IPNS records may take up to 60 minutes to propagate, unlike on-chain records that have instant resolution. This prioritizes security and data integrity over immediate availability. However, users have the option to export their IPNS private key and IPFS hash for use with other pinning services, resolving availability issues to some extent.

The platform's exciting features, like dynamic avatars and programmable addresses, open up new possibilities for users. With features such as wallet-specific records and on-chain signers for extra security, NameSys infrastructure is dirt-cheap and still highly secure. The team is actively working on additional enhancements, such as private payments to ENS names and dApp store redirects.

Overall, NameSys.eth provides a game-changing solution for ENS users, enabling free and secure off-chain record management. With its focus on security, autonomy, and dynamic possibilities, NameSys aims to transform the ENS community's experience, making free and secure records forever accessible to all users. Developers can explore the full specifications on GitHub and engage with the team to discuss APIs for dynamic avatars and further improvements.
